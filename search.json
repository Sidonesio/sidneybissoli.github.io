    "text": "[The notion of transference in “Studies on histeria” (Breuer & Freud, 1895)]\n[Paidéia]\n[Link to paper]\nThis article is part of a larger project, in which it intends to examine how the concept of transference is dealt in Freudian’s psychoanalysis. As the notion of transference appears by the first time in chapter 4 of “Estudos sobre a histeria”, this work acquires the status of the starting point to the examination of that. It verifies that the notion of transference can’t ever be understood as the whole relationship that a patient establishes with his psychoanalyst. It can’t either be understood as the total perturbation in this type of relationship, as it was further interpreted by other authors. It is only a very specific point of this relationship, in which, through a false bond, and in an uncommon way, the figure of the doctor replaces someone from the patient’s past."
